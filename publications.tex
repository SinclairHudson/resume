{\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07133}{Sim-to-Real Domain Adaptation for Lane Detection and Classification in Autonomous Driving}}
{June 2022}
{\bodytext{
\begin{itemize}
\item Co-authored a peer-reviewed \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07133}{research paper} on sim2real lane detection using the \href{https://carla.org/}{CARLA} simulator, integrating current GAN research with state-of-the-art lane detection models. 
\item Presented the paper at a poster board session during the \href{https://iv2022.com/}{Intelligent Vehicles 2022 symposium}.
% \item Deployed a lane detection model into the production C++ stack, using ROS and Intel OpenVINO, increasing model throughput by 200\%.
% \item Trained and deployed multiple computer vision models for autonomous vehicles, including a a YOLOv3 model for traffic light detection and an EfficientNet-based segmentation model for roadline detection.

{Application of Machine Learning for Drone Classification Using Radars}}
{April 2021}
{\bodytext{
\begin{itemize}
\item Authored a research paper and presented it at the \href{https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11756/117560C/Application-of-machine-learning-for-drone-classification-using-radars/10.1117/12.2588694.short?SSO=1}{SPIE 2021 Conference}, with a follow-up \href{https://www.mdpi.com/2504-446X/5/4/149}{peer-reviewed paper}.
\item Used a convolutional neural network to classify 5 different commercial drones based on a Fourier transform of their noisy RADAR return signal.
\item Created a detailed physics-based simulation of RADAR returns bouncing off of a drone in flight, and used the simulated data to validate classification methods.
%\item Came 1st place in the \href{https://github.com/SinclairHudson/CANSOFCOM}{Hack The North 2020++ CANSOFCOM Drone ML challenge}.
\end{itemize}
