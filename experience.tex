{Model Deployment Platform Engineer}
{Sept '22 -- Dec '22}
{\bodytext{
\begin{itemize}
%\item Developed various Python tools to deploy deep learning models on the vehicle, using \href{https://onnx.ai/}{ONNX},
   % \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt}{TensorRT}, and custom computation graph representations.
\item Developed debugging tools to assist in model deployment, reducing deployment time by days in some cases.
\item Built a tool to automatically assess numerical divergence between the original PyTorch models and optimized 
    \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt}{TensorRT} models, allowing deployment engineers to quickly identify optimization errors.
\item Built a linter to map \href{https://onnx.ai/}{ONNX} nodes to lines in PyTorch source code, saving deployment engineers hours of manual debugging every deployment.
\item Created a tool to manually add outputs to exported ONNX graphs, allowing engineers to inspect intermediate activations while debugging models.
\end{itemize}

{Machine Learning Developer}
{May '21 -- Aug '21}
{\bodytext{
\begin{itemize}
\item Built and tested defect detection deep learning solutions for clients in the manufacturing industry.
\item Trained XGBoost and SVR systems to model the relationship between environmental conditions and yield for an agriculture client,
    giving the client insight into the impact of environmental conditions on their yield.
\item Implemented the core functionality of Dataset Distillation using the autograd package, to pursue research in low-data machine learning contexts.
%\item Designed and created an anomaly detection research repository in PyTorch, for internal research detecting anomalies in images.
\item Implemented VAE, VQ-VAE, and VQ-VAE-2 from scratch in PyTorch, demonstrating the 
    effectiveness of autoencoders as anomaly detectors on client datasets.

{Software Developer}
{Sept '20 -- Dec '20}
{\bodytext{
\begin{itemize}
\item Contributed to a customer-facing Python library to quantize and optimize TensorFlow computation graphs.
\item Designed and implemented Non-Max Suppression for quantized values using only integer operations, allowing
    object detection pipelines to run 10x faster on-chip.
\item Experimented with different quantization schemes to improve the mAP of an SSD-ResNet-34 by 5\%.
 \item Implemented a lookup table class to represent arbitrary non-linear functions in a quantized space, 
     allowing the python library to support any activation function.
