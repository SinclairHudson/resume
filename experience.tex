{Model Deployment Platform Engineer}
{Sept '22 -- Dec '22}
{\bodytext{
\begin{itemize}
%\item Developed various Python tools to deploy deep learning models on the vehicle, using \href{https://onnx.ai/}{ONNX},
   % \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt}{TensorRT}, and custom computation graph representations.
\item Developed debugging tools to assist in model deployment, reducing deployment time by days in some cases.
\item Built a tool to automatically assess numerical divergence between the original PyTorch models and optimized models\
    using \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt}{TensorRT} and custom computation graph representations.
\item Built a linter to map \href{https://onnx.ai/}{ONNX} nodes to lines in PyTorch source code, saving model deployment engineers hours.
\item Created a tool to manually add outputs to exported ONNX graphs, allowing engineers to inspect intermediate activations while debugging models.
\end{itemize}
